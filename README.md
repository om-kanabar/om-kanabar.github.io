Om Kanabar Portfolio Website

Literally a personal website. Um, used ai for debugging and for creating commits since I have GitHub Pro (education). Hopefully you like it. I do not leave comments (so sad), but I am working on it. Also, I am of course still working on this and will probably be working on this for longer because I like to add unnecessary things that take up my time but are fun to do.
